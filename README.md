Please follow the link above to my Bellabeat Case Study on Kaggle.com, which I completed for the Google Data Analytics Certificaiton course.  

In this case study, I focused on cleaning a set of data submitted by Fitbit users.  This report is my own analysis of publicly available data. Bellabeat is a real company that makes heath trackers for women, however, I am not affiliated with Bellabeat in any way.
